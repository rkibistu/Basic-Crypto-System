# Basic-Crypto-System

  This is a simple project that implements encrypt and decrypt methods for RC4, chacha20, and AES algorithms.
  Some implementations use the EVP library, others use low API of the specific algorithms.
  
  The scope of this project is to learn and understand different modes of encryption.
